===========go variables====================

int- stores integers (whole numbers), such as 123 or -123
float32- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool- stores values with two states: true or false

=============declaring variables====================

---(1) with var keyword

var variableName variableType = Value;

var name string = "deshan";

----(2)  With the := sign:
variableNme := value

name := "deshan manodya"
NOTES :- here the type of the variabel is inferred, the compiler has to decide the type
NOTES :- It is not possible to declare a variable using :=, without assigning a value to it.
